SDK
CURRENT


You can customize your integration by passing query parameters and script parameters in the JavaScript SDK script tag. These parameters help PayPal decide the optimal funding sources and buttons to show to your buyers.

Query parameters
Query parameters are used to help define specific content or actions based on the data being passed. Each piece of data you send:

Is made up of a key-value pair. Keys define the piece of information needed and the value provides that information. The key is separated from the value by an equal sign (=).
Is proceeded by a question mark (?) to annotate that a question for a piece of information is being asked.
Is followed by an ampersand (&) if you need to provide more than one set at a time.
Contains necessary information that PayPal needs to handle your request.
For example, PayPal needs your authorization credentials and where you are to process your request:

<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&locale=en_US"></script>

Use these test parameters to see JavaScript SDK results. Not passing one triggers use of the default value listed.

Option	Example value	Default	Description
client-id	test	n/a	Required.

Your PayPal REST client ID. This identifies your PayPal account, and determines where any transactions are paid to. While you're testing in sandbox, you can use client-id=sb as a shortcut.
buyer-country	US, CA, GB, DE, FR	automatic	The buyer country. Available in Sandbox for testing.
commit	true, false	true	Set to true if the transaction is completed on the PayPal review page or false if the amount captured changes after the buyer returns to your site. Not applicable for subscriptions.
Important: If you're integrating with a PayPal API, make sure the commit value you pass in the API call matches the value you pass in the JavaScript call.
components	buttons	buttons	A comma-separated list of components to enable. Defaults to allow checkout buttons. Other components are optional.
currency	USD, CAD, EUR	USD	The currency of the transaction or subscription plan.
debug	true, false	false	Enable debug mode for ease of debugging. Do not enable for production traffic.
disable-card	visa	none	Deprecated. Cards to disable from showing in the checkout buttons.
disable-funding	card, credit, bancontact	none	Funding sources to disallow from showing in the checkout buttons. Do not use this query parameter to disable advanced credit and debit card payments.
enable-funding	venmo, paylater	none	Funding sources to allow in the checkout buttons.
integration-date	2018-11-30	automatic	The date of integration. Used to ensure backwards compatibility.
intent	capture, authorize, subscription, tokenize	capture	Determines whether the funds are captured immediately on checkout or if the buyer authorizes the funds to be captured later.
Important: If you're integrating with a PayPal API, make sure the intent value you pass in the API call matches the value you pass in the JavaScript call.
locale	en_US, fr_FR, de_DE	automatic	The locale used to localize any components. PayPal recommends not setting this parameter, as the buyer's locale is automatically set by PayPal.
merchant-id	ABC123	automatic	The merchant for whom you are facilitating a transaction.
vault	true, false	false	Set to true if the transaction sets up a billing agreement or subscription.
Client ID
The client ID identifies the PayPal account that sets up and finalizes transactions. By default, funds from any transactions are settled into this account.

<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID"></script>

If you are facilitating transactions on behalf of other merchants and capturing funds into their accounts, see merchant ID.

Buyer country
The buyer country determines which funding sources are eligible for a given buyer. Defaults to the buyer's IP geolocation.

Note: Buyer country is valid only in sandbox and you should not pass it in production.

<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&buyer-country=DE"></script>

Any country that you can pass as a locale is a valid buyer country.

Commit
The commit status of the transaction. Determines whether to show a Pay Now or Continue button in the Checkout flow.

Use the Pay Now button when the buyer completes payment on the PayPal review page, for example, digitally-delivered items without shipping costs.
Use the Continue button when the buyer completes payment on your site to account for shipping, tax, and other items before submitting the order.
Important: If you're integrating with a PayPal API, make sure the commit value you pass in the API call matches the value you pass in the JavaScript call.

<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&commit=false"></script>

Option	Description
true	Default.
Show a Pay Now button in the PayPal Checkout flow. The final amount does not change after the buyer returns from PayPal to your site.
false	Show a Continue button in the PayPal Checkout flow. The final amount might change after the buyer returns from PayPal to your site, due to shipping, tax, or other fees.
Components
The PayPal components you intend to render on your page. Each component you use must be separated by a comma (,). If you don't pass any components, the default payment buttons component automatically renders all eligible buttons in a single location on your page. Components available to you:

Option	Description
buttons	Places all of the eligible checkout buttons on your page.
marks	Presents other funding sources on your page alongside PayPal using Radio Buttons.
messages	Displays messaging for the most relevant Pay Later offer for every purchase.
funding-eligibility	Allows you to choose the individual payment buttons (methods) you want to display on your web page.
hosted-fields	Shows your own hosted credit and debit card fields.
For example, you want to offer your buyers Pay Later options when they choose PayPal along with other payment options.

<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&components=buttons,marks,messages="></script>

Currency
The currency for the transaction. Funds are captured into your account in the specified currency. Defaults to USD.

Currency	Code
Australian dollar	AUD
Brazilian real	BRL
Canadian dollar	CAD
Czech koruna	CZK
Danish krone	DKK
Euro	EUR
Hong Kong dollar	HKD
Hungarian forint	HUF

Pound sterling	GBP
Russian ruble	RUB
Singapore dollar	SGD
Swedish krona	SEK
Swiss franc	CHF
Thai baht	THB
United States dollar	USD
Debug
Set to true to enable debug mode. Debug mode is recommended only for testing and debugging. This causes a significant increase in the size of the script and negative impact performance impact. Defaults to false.

<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&debug=true"></script>

Option	Description
true	Enable debug mode.
false	Disable debug mode.
Disable card
This parameter is deprecated. In previous versions of the JavaScript SDK that displayed individual card icons, this parameter disabled specific cards for the transaction. Any cards passed were not displayed in the checkout buttons.

<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&disable-card=amex,jcb"></script>

Option	Description
visa	Visa
mastercard	Mastercard
amex	American Express
discover	Discover
jcb	JCB
elo	Elo
hiper	Hiper
Disable funding
The disabled funding sources for the transaction. Any funding sources passed are not displayed in the checkout buttons. By default, funding source eligibility is determined based on a variety of factors. Do not use this query parameter to disable advanced credit and debit card payments.

Note: Pass credit in disable-funding for merchants that fall into these categories:

Real money gaming merchants
Non-US merchants who do not have the correct licenses and approvals to display the Credit button
<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&disable-funding=credit,card"></script>

Option	Description
card	Credit or debit cards
credit	PayPal Credit
bancontact	Bancontact
blik	BLIK
eps	eps
giropay	giropay
ideal	iDEAL
mercadopago	Mercado Pago
mybank	MyBank
p24	Przelewy24
sepa	SEPA-Lastschrift
sofort	Sofort
venmo	Venmo
Enable funding
The enabled funding sources for the transaction. By default, funding source eligibility is determined based on a variety of factors. Enable funding can be used to ensure a funding source is rendered, if eligible.

<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&enable-funding=venmo"></script>

Option	Description
card	Credit or debit cards
credit	PayPal Credit
paylater	Pay Later
venmo	Venmo
bancontact	Bancontact
blik	BLIK
eps	eps
giropay	giropay
ideal	iDEAL
mercadopago	Mercado Pago
mybank	MyBank
p24	Przelewy24
sepa	SEPA-Lastschrift
sofort	Sofort
Integration date
The integration date of the script, passed as a YYYY-MM-DD value. Defaults to the date when your client ID was created, and if passed, reflects the date that you added the PayPal integration to your site. This parameter ensures backwards compatibility.

<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&integration-date=2018-11-07"></script>

How this works:

Your site automatically gets any backward-compatible changes made to the PayPal script. These changes include:

New funding sources
Buttons
Updated user interfaces
Bug fixes
Security fixes
Performance optimizations
You do not need to change integration-date to enable new features.

Your site does not get any backward incompatible updates made to the PayPal script after the specified integration-date, or after the date your client-id was created, if you do not pass the integration-date parameter.

If your client-id does not change, you can safely omit the integration-date parameter and the PayPal script guarantees backward compatibility.

If your client-id changes dynamically, you must pass an integration date, which ensures that no breaking changes are made to your integration. This could be the case if you build a cart app, which enables merchants to dynamically set a client ID to add PayPal to their store.

Intent
The intent for the transaction. This determines whether the funds are captured immediately while the buyer is present on the page. Defaults to capture.

Important: If you're integrating with a PayPal API, make sure the intent value you pass in the API call matches the value you pass in the JavaScript call.

<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&intent=authorize"></script>

Option	Description
capture	The funds are captured immediately while the buyer is present on your site.
authorize	The funds are authorized immediately and then reauthorized or captured later.
subscription	Used along with vault=true to specify this is a subscription transaction.
tokenize	Used along with vault=true and createBillingAgreement() to specify this is a billing (without purchase) transaction.
Intent options when integrating with older APIs
If you're integrating the JavaScript SDK with an older API like the Orders V1 REST API or one of our NVP/SOAP solutions, you can use the following options.

Option	Description
capture or sale	The funds are captured immediately while the buyer is present on your site. The value you use should match the intent value in the API call.
authorize	The funds are authorized immediately and then reauthorized or captured later.
order	The funds are validated without an authorization and you can reauthorize or capture later.
Locale
The locale renders components. By default PayPal detects the correct locale for the buyer based on their geolocation and browser preferences. It is recommended to pass this parameter only if you need the PayPal buttons to render in the same language as the rest of your site.

Merchant ID
The merchant ID of a merchant for whom you are facilitating a transaction.

Use this parameter only for partner, marketplaces, and cart solutions when you are acting on behalf of another merchant to facilitate their PayPal transactions. This parameter is essential to guarantee the merchant sees the best possible combination of PayPal buttons.

<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&merchant-id=XXX"></script>

Integration	Use case	Client ID	Merchant ID	Other
Standalone integration	I am capturing funds directly into my PayPal account.	Pass a client ID associated with your account.	Do not pass merchant ID (it is automatically derived).	
Partner or Marketplace integration	I am facilitating payments on behalf of other merchants.	Pass a client ID associated with your partner or marketplace account.	You must pass the merchant ID of the merchant for whom you are facilitating payments.	
Cart integration	I am facilitating payments on behalf of other merchants and I have the client IDs for those merchants.	Pass the client ID of the merchant for whom you are facilitating payments.	Do not pass a merchant ID.	Pass the integration date parameter to ensure your integration does not break as new client IDs onboard to your site.
Vault
The vault status of the transaction. Vaulting allows you to store your customers' payment information for billing agreements, subscriptions, or recurring payments.

Note: Not all payment methods can be vaulted.

If the vault status is set to true:

It shows only the funding source you can add to the vault.
Sets up a billing agreement, reference transaction, or subscription.
Defaults to false.

<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&vault=true"></script>

Option	Description
true	Show only funding sources that you can vault or use to create a billing agreement, subscription, or recurring payment.
false	Show all funding sources.
Script parameters
Script parameters are additional key value pairs you can add to the script tag to provide information you need for your site to work, a nonce, or information you'd like to capture on a page for analytics reasons.

For example, a token that identifies your buyer:

<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID" data-client-token="abc123xyz=="></script>

Option	Description
data-csp-nonce	CSP nonce used for rendering the button.
data-client-token	Client token used for identifying your buyers.
data-order-id	Order ID used for optimizing the funding that displays.
data-page-type	Log page type and interactions for the JavaScript SDK.
